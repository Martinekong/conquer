**Conquer** is a booking platform for campervans in stunning destinations across the globe. Users can explore and filter destinations by continent or activity, book a campervan, manage their bookings via the dashboard, and cancel if needed. The app is built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, using LocalStorage to simulate a full booking system.

## Description

Conquer was developed as part of my journey to become a Frontend Developer. It allowed me to deepen my understanding of modern web development concepts and apply tools and techniques I hadnâ€™t used before.

- Destinations, activities, and testimonials are structured as arrays of objects, simulating external APIs.
- The booking form includes a calendar component.
- The About page features a promotional video for added media experience.

### Features

The app includes the following pages:

- **Home** - Hero section, popular destinations, featured activities, testimonials, and customer gallery.
- **Destinations** - View all destinations and filter by continent or activity.
- **Country** - Details of a single destination, including images, highlights, activities, and price.
- **Booking** - Select dates and book a campervan using a calendar-based form.
- **Dashboard** - Overview of all bookings (retrieved from LocalStorage).
- **Single Booking** - Detailed view of one booking, with the option to cancel.
- **About** - Information about Conquer, embedded video, and reasons to choose this service.
- **Contact** - Frequently asked questions and contact options.
